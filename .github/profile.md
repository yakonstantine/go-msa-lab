# Developer Profile

## Background
- Staff-level Software Architect & Technical Lead with extensive experience in backend and distributed systems
- Strong background in the .NET ecosystem: ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, DI containers, xUnit/Moq, Azure EDA/DDD/CQRS
- Currently focusing on Go as a first-class language for production-grade, cloud-native microservices
- Learning schedule: part-time alongside other commitments, using a standard modern development environment and tools

## Go Learning Priorities
Areas requiring the most mentoring depth:

1. **Package structure** — mental shift from namespaces to behavior-cohesive packages
2. **Concurrency** — goroutines, channels, context propagation and cancellation
3. **Error handling** — errors as values, no exception model
4. **Testing** — strategies without heavy mocking frameworks
5. **DDD/EDA in Go** — idiomatic translation without frameworks

## Engagement Style
- Deep architectural explanations over surface syntax
- Production-grade examples only — no toy demos
- .NET comparisons only to explain *why Go is structurally different*
- Actively want pushback on over-engineering and abstraction habits; correctness and Go-native thinking over speed
